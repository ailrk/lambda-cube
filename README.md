```

##### STLC
simply typed lambda calcus that only has typing for monotypes.
```
cabal run STLC
```

##### SystemF (L2)
Simply typed lambda calculus with polymorphic types.
```
cabal run SystemF
```

##### Lω
```
cabal run LOmega
```

##### CoC (λPω)
Calculus of construction. Types can depend on terms, terms can bind types, type and bind types.
```
